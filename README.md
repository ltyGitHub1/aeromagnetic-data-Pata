# aeromagnetic-data-Pata
The original aeromagnetic data of the Patagonia region originates from https://pubs.usgs.gov/of/2002/ofr-02-361/State_html/AZ.html. We used Golden Software Surfer to grid the original aeromagnetic data of Patagonia, and the gridded result was used for downward continuation experiments. The gridded result is stored in “M.mat”.
